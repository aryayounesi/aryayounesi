# About Me

I am Arya Younesi in the middle of my fourth decades of my life; born and live in Iran.
I'm going to write a few words about myself and if you think you'll read an interesting peace of writing, perhaps you are in a wrong way; since you will read a boring life.

<Sub> so reading discretion recommended; since you may spend your precious time on reading about a meaningless life.</sub>

## A life Through

my favorite is `C` for sure, and `PHP` for websites and things (I know its limits and problems but still it's good). I am a fan of **Fedora GNU/Linux** for many reasons and using it.
I learned `QBasic`, `VisualBasic` and `C` when I was a teenager, high school student; that time learned also `HTML`, `CSS`, some *WebAPI*, etc. Back then we, my brother and I, were teens, with no concern for life and difficulties, so we were trying things from **FreeDOS** to *Lindows*. I remember the last program, before college, I built was a simple app with great GUI in *VB* which count the exact words of a text; note it worthy that time MS Word couldn't have count words very well, especially in RTL languages. mine did it very well since it was designed for RTL languages, e.g. Persian.
then when I went to University, major in Statistics, there we have an intense course on `Cpp` and also many courses on mathematics, mathematic foundation, set theory, mathematical logic (which I had some knowledge before), some personal study on **Turing machines**, and the most excellent logical proof I had ever seen, **Kurt Godel's theorem**.
Clearly I remember another thing which is `R` language. Among statistics courses there were two different things: firstly, Cpp, second, was SPSS. The latter was a statistical application which was popular; that time I had thought for my self why should we use an application, i.e., SPSS that its learning take a huge time and that time would be spent on one thing, the application; instead of it, a good idea is we use `R`. I started it but not to a good level. Because eagerly reading philosophy books, wasn't focused, felt not well personally, and I can't help it but I thought `R` is old and dead; mostly based on appearances which R hadn't had good GUI. Now 15 years have passed and `R` still is powerful.
I was young, far from any kind of maturity. Laymen have an idiom in Persian which says *"a mad has been told that watch out the youth are coming!"*
Then I left Statistics to study philosophy, since I love math but more love for humanities, particularly philosophy. Parental push and social misjudgments made me to sought something ~*serious*~, which I did and was wrong.

## Philosophy, Language and Codes

so I started studying philosophy. as you may know, **language** is a core concept in contemporary philosophy and artificial languages are good topics to assess. after a while of no coding I started a new way: interdisciplinary study through **philosophy of language**, **linguistics**, **artificial languages**, and **programming languages**, all personal. learned some `Python`, `Rust`, `GTK` and `JS` (never loved it),and recently `V`, `Vala`, `Ruby` *(perhaps the most interesting one which a friend told me about)*, and have in mind `Crystal`. in addition, sometimes play with FreeBasic and QB64; they're nostalgic for me and very interesting; this project may gain some success in their way.
Perhaps I should stated it clearly that I *don't know all these languages like a developer should know*, but *I'm familiar with them, their syntax and semantics, the way the language has built up, the way the language communicates with both the machine and the developer, their security problems, etc*. Sometimes I play with them, I mean writing some strange codes seeing how the language, the debuggers and compilers deal with issues, or to what extent it's easy to fool compilers. If I want to develop something serious I use my favorites: `C`, for GUI with C `GTK`, `PHP`, etc. For the moment Rust catches my attention however its community isn't helpful (I heard the same from other people, hope they build a COC for it). Also, these days, with a help of a sophisticated friend got interested in `Ruby`, which is very nice, like you're sending text messages to the machine! More importantly perhaps an alternative to JS would be necessary and `Ruby` fit that task.
In the past, I was viewing these matters from Analytical philosophy point of view, but some years ago my mindset changed in favor of Continental philosophy of language, I mean **Hermeneutics**, *de Saussure structuralism* and *deconstruction*. however, still think **Chomsky**, **Godel**, **Turing** and **Quine** are related. Analytical philosophy focuses intensely on artificial things and likes to use symbols and a jargon; but it's not helpful. going this way may lead me to write an entire book here, so I'm bringing an end to it here.

## Why I am here

generally speaking I'm not fan of social platforms, because social platforms are places that most **serious words fall on deaf ears**; you have to be dummy, saying strange things and confirm wide spread believes, if not you're invisible or perhaps a visible target for offenders. I'm not telling the world is dark, but the essence of social media needs to be very weird, people come to media for interesting things, not boring, correct ones.
reasons for being here aren't known even for myself, but I give it a try. during COVID-19 pandemic working from home cause a lot of spare time. also, all people relied on IT more than ever; I had seen many people have problem with IT matters which showed we should step in and fortified people with computer sciences. we all need it to handle machines, if not the machines will handle us and cancel our choices.
I am seeing young guys who are learning programming, as far as I can see the way they receive teachings is doomed; since everywhere is full of nonsense:
> C is such and such, memory leak and things ...

True, but still it could be used for embedded systems, employed as educational language, as many post-C languages mimic it's syntax and semantics if someone knows C, they knows a portion of many language.

> PHP ouches ...

This one could be justified at its face value, so I'm not going to say anything about it. However, a half of those people promote JS; I, for one, never understand the unique merits of JS, also I remember the controversy and competition between Netscape and MS. JS push junior developers to focus on messy designs with a lot of security problems, as well as lazy JS syntax make them bad coders that wouldn't pay attention to writing well-formed, tidy, and clear codes; I may be on the wrong side though but used my freedom of speech here.

> cyber security? tell me what is that!

When **cyber security** undermined we should run.
so tutors just teach JS with no CS concerns, focusing only on shiny design with a lot of assets, promoting dead languages like VB DotNet. finally, the saddest part: an army of teenagers who love hacking, not the white or red way; while they had better to love making some applications, they love to ruining applications.
Other reason was that I lost many works which left me with time, gloomy mood and wondering. thus, I thought it's time to do some codes and help youngers through it. I'm doing the former, and had some personal projects on the go (personal because never think of programming as a source of income, and still I don't, perhaps I should do it); but the latter, was a failure. nowadays kids aren't like the way we were; when you tell them something either ignore you or offer some offensive words. I don't know why they should be like that.

## future plans

now I'm working on some personal projects, with no sponsors, about building a website for **free teaching** about `programming` and **GNU/Linux**, and a platform, perhaps tools too; for, **kids with special needs** to learn **GNU/Linux** and finally coding. these kids left out, has no voice and no one wants to give them powerful tools to make their way through this world of codes. I couldn't fullfil it certainly but I want to try my best. also I want to give academic people a few things to build websites and things for themselves, not like the way let say CMSs do it.  

## My Preferred Code of Conduct

you're right, see such a title here is strange; actually I cheated. I want to use this opportunity to preach! sorry.
since I was teenager and active in programming communities, things have changed vigorously. now I'm seeing some, not all, programmers who are experts on being arrogant and look over people, including myself; perhaps because my academic field isn't computer science. they do the same to others. that's unbearable because the world of 0/1 is multidisciplinary and it's possible for all to participate, actually it's necessary. some may say: "true; but you studied something else". that's correct but there are good examples Chomsky's contribution to compilers, John McFarlane with his great tools, `PanDoc` would be enough. plus, there is a way to be polymath, however you lost many pleasing things forever.
sometimes I tell kids to do such and such in social rooms and I give rude behavior from developers; guys I'm suffering from insomnia from my juvenile. instead of pure suffering I change it to a way of learning: when I'm tired and can't sleep just study interesting things so that time you were sleeping or in a date I was do something else. it's not easy, whoever knows what really is insomnia, unlike the shinny name, knows how you feeling. to name one it's more than three years I'm dealing with a chronic dry eye syndrome.
also, I can't understand why Open Source community ended up here, what really happened? in any case, Open Source community is alive by collaboration, unity and contribution. we should continue that.
Furthermore, please use **GNU/Linux** everywhere if you mean the OS, not specifically the Kernel; let's give proper courtesy to GNU developers who do a great job and not only no one recall the names but also we eliminate the indicator acronym, **GNU**, from our words.
