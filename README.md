# Outline

My primary focus is on something other than developing application, I do want to do that, but I am interested in more serious matters; thus here is a note to the reader.

## Corpus Codices

[Corpus Codices](https://aryayounesi.github.io/index.html) is my Github page which I am using it for writings on `DOM`, `Markups Languages`, **_programming languages_**, **compilers**, _Open Source_, **free software Idea**, and more importantly on **people with special needs**, those who has no voice when it comes to the matters of codes, and anything like this. For the moment the page and its basic skeleton is ready and uploaded; for the writings a part about [Prolegomenon to Lightweight Markup Languages](https://aryayounesi.github.io/pages/markups/Prolegomenon.html) and [The Merit and Love of Lightweight Markup Languages](https://aryayounesi.github.io/pages/markups/merit_and_love.html) is uploaded; the rest would be up soon.

## About Me

if you want to read about me, which is strange as why should I would be an interesting _rational animal_ as Aristotle used to define humans like that, you can find a note [here](/pages/AboutMe.md); Reading discretion recommended; since you may spend your precious time on reading about a meaningless life.
In addition, I am from a philosophic background, hence you would not find statements like:

>I'm curious about learning new things.

>learning never would be enough.

>I like to work in a team.

I, for one, may have such psychological traits but what is the reason for mentioning them? especially, when **language makes lies possible**. All those who does not have those habits can say that.

## Rights of People with No Voice

This part, personally, would be the most important part; because IT world does not really care about special groups, even sometimes is cruel towards them. As if in IT world there is no room for certain groups, such as people with special needs, blind people, people physical or mental disabilities, children form middle class and below families. I do not mean that they have not _accessability_ helps for using systems, but why there is not any serious effort to teach them programming? why in designing programming languages no one think about a kind of syntax that is more convenient for people with special needs? why no IDE put a really useful accessability options in its core?
This matters would be discussed on my page, and if the costs of life let me, I am working on some projects for those people with no voice.
By _**with no voice**_, I mean groups that has no one to speak for; for instance, women have real difficulties in the world but they have a lot of voice to speak on their behalf.
