# About Me
I am Arya Younesi in the middle of my fourth decades of my life; born and live in Iran. 
my favorite is C for sure, and PHP for websites and things (I know its limits and problems but still it's good).
I learned QBasic, VisualBasic and C when I was a teenager, highschool student; that time learned also HTML, CSS, some WebAPI, etc.
then when I went to University, major in Statistics, there we have an intense course on Cpp and also many courses on mathematics, mathematic foundation, set theory, mathematical logic (which I had some knowledge before), some personal study on Turing machines, and the most excellent logical proof I had ever seen, Kurt . then I left Statistics to study philosophy, since I love math but more love for humanities, particularly philosophy. Parental push and social misjudgements made me to sought something *serious*, which I did and was wrong. so I started studying philosophy. as you may know, **language** is a core concept in contemporary philosophy and artificial languages are good topics to assess.
